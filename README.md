# Seismic Data Analysis and Visualization Tool

## Description:
    This Python program aims to facilitate the analysis and visualization of seismic data in the Willamette Valley region of Oregon, USA.
    It utilizes the ObsPy library for seismic data processing, matplotlib, and pygmt for visualization, and pandas for data manipulation.
    The program downloads seismic waveform data from specified stations and earthquakes within a defined time frame and geographical region.
    It computes various parameters such as distances between stations and events and provides interactive maps for visualizing seismic stations and earthquakes.

## Installation:
    To run this program, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
    Install the required dependencies using the following commands:
### 1. Install ObsPy library for seismic data processing: `pip install obspy`
### 2. Install Matplotlib for visualization: `pip install matplotlib`
### 3. Install PyGMT library for interactive maps: `pip install pygmt`
### 4. Install Pandas library for data manipulation: `pip install pandas`
    Modify the parameters in the program according to your preferences and execute the script.

## How to Use:
    Set the parameters in the program according to your study requirements, such as geographical region, time frame, and station configurations.
    Run the program and follow the prompts to download seismic waveform data and compute various parameters.
    Visualize the results using the provided interactive maps and plots.
